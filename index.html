    <h3>Here's a little bit about myself:</h3> 
        <p>My name is Ben Cunningham (He/Him) and I'm a current student at CU Boulder.</p>
        <p>I'm a business student but I've never strayed from my creative side. I'm and avid photographer and I love spending my time outdoors. Whether it's skiing, surfing, hiking, or camping. I'll never say no to an adventure.</p>
        <p>My main goal for this course is to build a photo portfolio for my work!</p>
