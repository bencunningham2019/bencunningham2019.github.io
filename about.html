            My name is Ben Cunningham and I'm an avid photographer, designer, and creative based in Boulder, CO. Growing up in California, I have always had a 
            huge influence by the ocean and nature. This heavily inspired my photographic style and allowed me to work on countless projects in these settings growing up. 
            This continued into college where I continued this passion for nature and the outdoors.  
        </p>

        <p class="p_2">
            I have spent countless hours discovering new places, meeting new people, and capturing these moments. This has allowed me to hoan my craft in many 
            different subject matters of photography. Please reach out if you have any projects in mind that I can aid to. This is where I loved to capture people in their element. 
            Whether it was portraits, skiing, skating, or anything in between, these photos allowed me to display the emotions and feelings of people and places.
